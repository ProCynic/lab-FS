CS372 Project 3 - An Atomic Disk</h2>
<p>
<b>Due: </b>5:59:59 PM November 15 2010</p>
</center>
<HR>

<h3>
Assignment Goals</h3>

<ul>
<li>
To learn about key file system concepts: logging and transactions</li>

<li>
To provide the basis for project 4, where you will build a reliable file system.</li>

</ul>

<h3>
Overview of Project</h3>

<blockquote>In projects 3 and 4, you will construct a user-level library that presents the
  abstraction of a reliable file system called RFS. In order to manage the complexity, you
  will implement this system in 4 phases, each of which presents a successively
  higher-level abstraction. You will be given the abstraction of a raw disk
  interface. On top of this you will build
  <ol>
    <li>An atomic disk</li>
    <li>A reliable multi-level tree</li>
    <li>A reliable flat file system</li>
    <li>A reliable directory-based file system (RFS)</li>
  </ol>
  <p>This project, project 3, deals only with step 1 above. It is very important
  to do an excellent job on this part of the project, or you will have
  significant problems in the next part.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>
The Assignment</h3>

<blockquote>Before you begin the assignment, grab the following
code: <a href="lab-FS.tar">lab-FS.tar</a>
<p>This tar archive contains the source code to the raw disk interface as well
as files defining the other interfaces listed below. To extract the files from the archive, use the following command.
<blockquote><tt>tar -xvf lab-FS.tar</tt></blockquote>
  A directory called <b><tt>lab-FS/</tt></b> will be created,
and your files will be extracted into it.

<blockquote>
  <p class="MsoNormal">RFS will be implemented using an 8-Mbyte file with a
  &quot;device driver&quot; that treats this storage space as a contiguous array
  of raw disk sectors, each of size Disk.SECTOR_SIZE bytes. This driver is similar to
  Linux's block device interface. The disk sectors are numbered from 0 to Disk.<i>NUM_OF_SECTORS</i>- 1 inclusive.
  No partial read or write to a disk sector is
  possible. This important restriction has several implications on the design of
  the file system. For example, updating a single byte in a disk sector requires
  that the sector be read in memory, modified, and then written back to disk.
  Similarly, reading a single byte in a disk sector requires that the sector be
  read entirely from disk though only one byte is to be read.</p>

  <h2>&nbsp;</h2>
  <h2>Disk</h2>
  <p>A <a href="Disk.java">Disk</a> provides an asynchronous interface: requests
  are issued and later a callback provides the results of the action. When you
  create a Disk, you register an object that will receive callbacks:</p>
  <p>  public <b>Disk(DiskCallback callback, float failProb)</b>  throws FileNotFoundException</p>
  <p>The callback is an object that will receive notifications when operations
  complete (see below). If the failProb exceeds 0.0, then the disk will fail
  after each operation with the specified probability; this parameter is for
  testing and debugging. For convenience we also provide a method to change this probability
  as the disk runs. The source file provides more details about the arguments
  and exceptions for this and all other methods discussed here.</p>
  <p>Once a Disk is created, the following method initiates a read or write
  request:</p>
  <p>public void <b>startRequest(int operation, int tag, int
  sectorNum, byte b[]) </b>    throws IllegalArgumentException,
  IOException</p>
  <UL>
  <p><I>operation</I> is Disk.READ or Disk.WRITE</p>
  <p><I>tag</I> is an identifier
  the caller may user to match replies with requests. Disk does not
  interpret tag, it just passes it through with the request so that
  the callback corresponding to the request has the same tag. Note
  that the value DiskResult.RESERVED_TAG is reserved for error
  signaling. </p>
  <p><I>sectorNum</I> identifies the sector to access</p>
  <p><I>b[]</I> is a byte array from which to write or into which to
  read (depending on the operation).</p>
    </UL>
  <p><i>Warning</i>: You must not re-use b[] until the operation is complete.</p>
  <p><i>Warning</i>: You are not guaranteed that writes will complete in the
  order they are issued. In fact, the thread inside of Disk will process pending
  requests in a random order.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>DiskCallback, DiskResult, and DiskUnit</h2>
  <p>A <a href="DiskCallback.java">DiskCallback</a> defines an interface that
  must be implemented by an object that receives completion notices in the form
  of a <a href="DiskResult.java">DiskResult</a> when a read or request finishes.</p>
  <p>public void <b> requestDone(DiskResult result)</b></p>
  <p>So, when the operation you started with Disk::startRequest() completes,
  DiskCallback::requestDone() will be called. <a href="DiskUnit.java">DiskUnit</a>
  gives some examples of how this works.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>&nbsp;
  <p>Your task is to design, implement, and thoroughly test an <i>atomic disk.</i>
  The atomic disk allows a series of writes to different sectors to be made and
  then atomically applied -- either all the writes occur or none of them do. The
  atomic disk presents a similar interface to the disk, except (a) each read and
  write includes a transaction ID and (b) there are additional calls to begin,
  commit, abort, and apply transactions. You will implement this atomicity by
  providing an <b>redo log</b> on disk This redo log will consume
  ADisk.REDO_LOG_SECTORS
  sectors of your disk, so users of the ADisk will see a Disk.NUM_OF_SECTORS -
  ADisk.REDO_LOG_SECTORS disk.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In particular, an <a HREF="ADisk.java">ADisk</a> implements the
  following interface:</p>
  <p>  // Allocate an ADisk that stores its data using<br>
  // a Disk.<br>
  //<br>
  // If format is true, wipe the current disk<br>
  // and initialize data structures for an empty&nbsp;<br>
  // disk.<br>
  //<br>
  // Otherwise, initialize internal state, read the log,&nbsp;<br>
  // redo any committed transactions, and reset the log.<br>
  public <b> ADisk(boolean format)</b></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>  // Return the total number of data sectors that<br>
  // can be used *not including space reseved for<br>
  // the log or other data sructures*. This<br>
  // number will be smaller than Disk.NUM_OF_SECTORS.<br>
  public <b>int getNSectors()</b></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>// Begin a new transaction and return a transaction ID<br>
  public <b>TransID beginTransaction()</b></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> // Store the update in an in-memory buffer associates with<br>
  // the specified transaction, but don't write it to the log yet.<br>
 public <b>void writeSector(TransID tid, int sectorNum, byte buffer[])</b>&nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; throws IllegalArgumentException,    IndexOutOfBoundsException</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>  // Read the disk sector numbered sectorNum and place<br>
  // the result in buffer. Note: the result of a read of a<br>
  // sector must reflect the results of all previously<br>
  // committed writes as well as any uncommitted writes<br>
  // from the transaction tid. The read must not<br>
  // reflect any writes from other active transactions<br>
  // or writes from aborted transactions.<br>
  void <b> readSector(TransID tid, int sectorNum, byte buffer[])&nbsp;<br>
  </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; throws IOException, IllegalArgumentException,    IndexOutOfBoundsException</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> // Write all of the transaction's updates to the log.<br>
  // Then, wait until all of those writes are safely on disk.<br>
  // Then, write "commit" to the log</br>
  // Then, wait until the "commit" is safely on disk.<br>
  // Ensure that eventually,<br>
  // the updates within the transaction are<br>
  // writen to their specified sectors, but don't wait for<br>
  // the writeback to finish before returning<br>
  void <b> commitTransaction(TransID tid)</b>&nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; throws IOException, IllegalArgumentException</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>// Free up the resources for this transaction without<br>
  // committing any of the writes.<br>
  void <b> abortTransaction(TransID tid)</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; throws IllegalArgumentException<br>
  </p>
  <p></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>



  <h2><b>Asynchronous IO</b></h2>
  <p>Writes to the log within a transaction must be asynchronous -- (1) write() must
  return without waiting for its write to go to disk. (2) When a transaction commits,
  you must first send the writes to the log and wait for all of the pending writes within a transaction to
  be safely stored to the log. (3) Only after that has happened can you write the commit record to the
  log. (4) Only after the commit is safely in the log, can the commit() call
  return. (5) Only after the commit has completed, you should arrange
  for the updates to get written to their final locations on disk. (6)
  The commit() call should return before these write-backs (to the
  final locations on disk) complete; it <I>may</I> return before these
  write-backs are even issued (e.g., another thread may issue those writes.)</p>

 <p><I>Hint:</I> If two transactions update the same sector, you need
  to make sure that the write from the transaction that <I>commits
  later</I> happens <I>after</I> the write from the earlier-committed
  transaction.  A good way to do this might be to have a
  producer/consumer queue for committed transactions' writes. Then, commit()
  puts a set of writes into the queue, and a single write-back thread
  pulls a transaction's writes from the queue, asynchronously issues
  them all, waits for them all to complete, and then moves to do the
  write-back for the next transaction's writes.</p>


  <p><I>Hint: </I> The log will have a sequence of writes for a
  transaction followed by a commit record for that transaction (or no
  commit record if the system crashed before the commit made it to disk.) The
  problem is: How do you know if the sector you are reading is a
  "commit" or just a sector update that happens to look like a
  "commit"? You also need to know which sectors were updates by the
  transaction's writes. So, you probably want to preceed a transaction's writes in the
  log with a description of the transaction's writes: how many are
  there, what sector is updated by each write, etc. Thus, it may be
  useful if your log looks like: [transaction_metadata [sectors]* transaction_commit]*</p>



  <h2><b>Concurrency</b></h2>
  <p>Note that your implementation must use locks and
      condition variables to enforce concurrency control. </p>

  <p>One shared data structure you are likely to have will be an
  object to represent each in-progress transaction. Multiple threads may concurrently attempt to
  read/write/commit/abort the same transaction. Your code must
  synchronize such concurrent access. 

  <p>Multiple in-progress transactions may try to update the same
  sector. A read by transaction <i>T</i> of sector <i>S</i>
  must return the data from the latest write to sector <i>S </i>by transaction <i>T</i>,
  if any. If transaction <i>T</i> has not updated sector <i>S</i>, then a read
  must return the data written by last write of sector <i>S</i> by the
  last-committed
  transaction <i>T'</i> that wrote sector <i>S</i>.</p>

  <p><I>Hint:</I> If you have a per-transaction set of updates and a
  write-back queue of committed transactions' writes, then a read
  could first check it's transaction, then check the write-back queue,
  and then, if necessary, read from disk. When you read from the
  write-back queue, make sure you enforce the "last commit wins" rule.</p>

  <p><I>Hint:</I> It is logically possible to have two transactions
  committing "at the same time", so that, for example, both  t1 and t2
  issue their writes to the log at the same time (to different
  locations in the log, obviously). Then, t1 and t2 could both issue
  their commits. This "optimization" is not required. In fact, it is a
  probably a bad idea for at least two reasons. First, it will
  complicate recovery (after a crash transaction i in the log may not
  have a commit in the log, but transaction i+1 or i+7 may). Second, to the extent that the updates get
  performed in a way that takes advantage of this extra concurrency,
  performance would be worse not better (due to extra rotational
  delays between writing a transaction's data and its commit.) (Note
  that a more sophisticated Disk interface would allow you to issue
  the writes (first part of step 2 above), then issue a barrier, and then issue the commit
  (step 4) without waiting for any of the writes to complete; the disk
  scheduler would make sure that all operations before the barrier
  complete before any operation after the barrier; that way the commit would get written after the writes
  without having to wait for a full rotation of the disk.)  The point
  of this whole hint is: You probably want to ensure that only one
  thread/transaction is doing a commit at a time.


<h2><b>Recovery</b></h2>
<p>  When your system starts, you need to make sure that all updates in the log from
  committed 
  transactions (1) are immediately visible to reads and (2) are eventually written to their final locations on
  disk. So, your recovery code must read data from the logs, update in
memory data structures, update disk, or both. Make sure you follow the ordering rule above (if two
  transactions update the same sector, the update from the transaction
  that <I>committed last</I> is the one that must "win".)  Notice that
  transactions may not commit in the same order that they begin, so
  the <I>tid</I> you assign when a transaction starts cannot be used
  to order updates on recovery.</p>

  <p><I>Hint: </I>One option is to have special-purpose code that
  reads each transaction from the log, does that transaction's
  write-back, waits for the write-back to complete, and then goes on
  to the next committed transaction. But there may be a simpler way:
  you probably already have code that applies a list of transactions
  in a specified order. Can you re-use that code?</p>

 <H2><B>Circular log</B></H2>

<p>Your on-disk log is fixed size, and you should treat it as a
circular log with new updates added at the head and the tail pointing
to the oldest update from a committed transaction that has not been
written back to its final location on disk. So, every write to a transaction moves the head forward. 
And, when a write-back completes, the tail moves forward. Obviously,
you must make sure the head does not pass the tail.</p>

<p>If a transaction tries to commit when there is not room to send its
writes to the log, the commit call should block until the transaction's
updates and commit can be written to the log. (If a single transaction
has too many writes to fit in the log, even if the log were otherwise
empty, you should throw an exception either on the culprit write or on
the commit.)  </p>

<p>On recovery, ideally the recovery thread would read the log from
the tail to the head so that it can commit exactly the writes that
have not been written back yet. Note, however, that it is safe to
start <I>before</I> the tail -- it is no problem to re-write-back a
write that has already been written back (as long as ordering
constraints are followed.) So, you don't need to have a perfect
on-disk head or tail pointer. Still, it may simplify things if you
know about where the tail is. One option is to store a "pre-tail"
pointer in a well-known sector on disk. The pre-tail must always be
at or before the tail and the head may not cross the pre-tail. Note
that the "pre-tail" is not necessary. Another option is to append to the
log "write-back-complete" records that state "the write-back for
transaction TID is complete." There are other options, too.</p>

<p>As your career progresses, you will find that writing simple
sanity-check tests for each object you write will save you enormous
amounts of time and make you a much more productive programmer. So, we
should not have to require you to write any specific tests because you
should already be planning to do so. But, thorough testing of this
part of the project is so important to the rest of the project, that
we're going to require it.</p>

<p>Write a program called ADiskUnit that executes a series of unit
tests for ADisk. Designing such tests is a skill that deserves
practice, so we do not provide a full list of what you should
test. You might start with simple reads and writes within a
transaction. Then look at reads and writes across transactions that
commit or abort. Be sure to test garbage collection and crash recovery. You
should have some tests with a single thread and some with more.  
Should probably have some tests for the simple case when the
disk doesn't crash and some for the case where it does. Etc. We strongly
recommend writing the tests as you add each piece of functionality rather than
trying to write a bunch of tests as an afterthought once you have finished the
project.</p>

<p>The TA will also have a set of unit tests (other than yours) to use
for grading your code. So, passing your tests is not necessarily
enough. But, if you design good tests, then passing your tests makes
it much more likely that you will pass the TA's tests.</p>

<p>Additional comments</p>
<UL>
<LI>Your tests must be self-checking. That is, after each test, you
should output a simple statement like "Test Succeeds" or "Test Fails."
(e.g., you should not require a human to read through 100 lines of output to
see if the read on line 92 matches the write on line 7; instead, your
unit test program should remember the earlier write it did and compare
the read result to it.)<br>

    <li>It is extremely important that you get each part of the project
      completely working before you move on to the next part. Bugs here could
      manifest in very strange behavior that will be difficult to diagnose in
      higher levels of the code. A general principle in engineering complex
      systems is &quot;go from working system to working system.&quot; That is,
      build core functionality, debug it, then add a small subset of
      functionality and test that. It is much easier to find a bug by testing a
      100-line module 20 minutes after you write it than to find the same bug by
      testing the entire 2000 line system after a week of writing code. <b><i>If
      you try to write all your code first and test it later, you are very
      likely to fail this project.</i></b> If you thoroughly test each module
      and each interface as you write it, each module may seem to take 10%
      longer, but the overall project will take much less time. It is also much
      more likely to work. Thorough testing of each phase of the project is a
      requirement of this project.<br>
</li>
    <li>Begin this part of the project by writing down your main data
      structures, and then writing pseudo-code for each of the above functions
      in terms of methods on these data structures. Given the number
      of threads and objects, think about how to structure your
      modules for safe locking that avoids deadlock. A picture may
      help you here.<br>
</li>

  <LI>You need to be able to take an object in memory, store it to
  disk as an array of bytes, and later reconstruct the object
  by reading an array of bytes from disk and converting those
  bytes to an object. Java provides a <I>serialization</I> interface
  for accomplishing this type of things. See, for example <A
  HREF="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Programming/serialization/">http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Programming/serialization/</A>. Note
  that this example writes directly to a FileOutputStream, but you may
  instead want to write to a ByteArrayOutputStream and then write the
  ByteArray to a specific offset in your file. Similarly, you may want
  to read a byte array from a specific offset of your file and then
  use that byte array via a ByteArrayInputStream.</LI>
